    <h2>Hey, how about you consider reading anyfuckingthing on our site</h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for the submission. However, the goal of our journal is to publish work outside of people's primary genre (
      <a href="https://www.genre2.org/submit.html">https://www.genre2.org/submit.html</a>) so we can't consider this. If you'd like to send us work outside of your primary genre we'd be happy to check it out.
      <br />
      <br />Warm regards,
      <br />g2 editors

      Thank you for your interest in genre2. We appreciate the chance to consider your work; unfortunately, we were unable to find a place for it in our upcoming issue. Please do keep us in mind for future work.
